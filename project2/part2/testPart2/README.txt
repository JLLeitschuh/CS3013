How to run test
Run make to make multiple executable files named long# (# can be 1 to 6).
Run each file separetely with 'time ./long#' 
OR run the ./bacthRun to run all of them in the background
Each long# take aprox 18 seconds to run normally.

Then smite using the smite command in the parent directory.
Unsmite when you want.
The time should be longer than the expected 18 seconds for each file.
